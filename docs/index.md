# S1 Scheme

S1 is a Scheme interpreter written in Rust. It implements [R7RS-small](https://standards.scheme.org/corrected-r7rs/r7rs.html), the current Scheme standard, with one deliberate omission: there are no complex numbers. Everything else in the standard is there: hygienic `syntax-rules` macros, libraries and `import`, exact rationals and arbitrary-size integers, full Unicode characters and strings, first-class continuations, `dynamic-wind`, exceptions, parameters, records, bytevectors, binary and textual ports, and proper tail calls.

These pages are a quick guide. Each one summarizes what a part of the language does in s1 and notes where s1 makes a choice the standard leaves open. For the precise definition of any form or procedure, follow the links to the R7RS report:

* [R7RS-small, corrected HTML edition](https://standards.scheme.org/corrected-r7rs/r7rs.html) (the version these pages link to; it includes the published errata)
* [R7RS-small, official PDF](https://small.r7rs.org/attachment/r7rs.pdf)

## Getting started

```bash
cargo build --release
target/release/s1                    # start the REPL
target/release/s1 hello.scm a b      # run a program with arguments, then exit
```

At the REPL, each result is printed after `=>`:

```scheme
s1> (define (fact n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (fact (- n 1)))))
=> fact
s1> (fact 20)
=> 2432902008176640000
s1> (exact->inexact 1/3)
=> 0.3333333333333333
```

A program can begin with the usual `(import (scheme base) ...)`, but doesn't need to: every standard binding is already available. See [Program Structure](./program-structure.md) for how programs and the REPL work, and [System Interface](./system-interface.md) for the command line.

## Conformance

s1 passes every test in chibi-scheme's R7RS test suite except those involving complex numbers. [Standards Conformance](./conformance.md) lists where s1 differs from the report and how it settles the questions the report leaves to the implementation.
